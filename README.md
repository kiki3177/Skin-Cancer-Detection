# Skin-Cancer-Detection

The final project for University of Washington IMT 575 Data ScienceIII.



Original dataset (HAM10000) source: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T



The project demonstrated the potential of CNN models in automating skin cancer detection using the HAM10000 dataset. 

We evaluated three pre-trained models: 

- GoogleNet achieved a test accuracy of 85.07%

- ResNet-152 achieved a test accuracy of 91.66%

- MobileNet achieved a test accuracy of 92%

However, the data imbalance problem poses a significant challenge and we proposed the data augmentation strategy for future implementation.
